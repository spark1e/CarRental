This project is an authorization form for user login. Program checks if the username and password entered by the user
are matched with any record in the database. Error window is displayed if username/password fields are empty or login
is failed. The window is draggable and users can use the tab and enter keys on textboxes. The new user is added to 
the local database with Register Form. This form checks if the username already exists. Password requirements will be
implemented in the next version of this program. A local SQL database is used to store user information. SQL connection
and query are used in the code. GUI is designed using C++/CLI .NET for Visual Studio 2022.
