This project is an autharization form for user log in. Program checks if username and password entered by user are
matched with any record in the database. Error window is displaid if username/password fields are empty or log in 
is failed. Window is draggable and user can use tab and enter keys on textboxs. New user is added to the local 
database with Register Form. This form checks if username already exists. Password requirements will be implemented
in the next version of this program. Local SQL database is used to store user information. SQL connection and query
are used in the code. GUI is decigned using C++/CLI .NET for Visual Studio 2022.
